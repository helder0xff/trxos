#2 Standarize naming.
#3 _set_fastest_clk:
	Make this function more like a run time configuration of the OS so we
	can choose between fast and accurate or slow (low energy) and no so 
	accurate.
#4 Make the code HW agnostic with #defines.
#5 Implement tests.
	* 	There is main with LL unitary test ready to be integrated in a well 
		designed test system at the root of this folder.
#6 Review mail module.
#7 Use the _sleep_flag & _blocked_flag as threads ids, instead
booleans. Might make the system more efficient.	
#8 Use a semaphore instead the _supend_flag.
#9 Move the run faster outside of the OS.

DONE
#1 LL: initialize linked list with no head.
